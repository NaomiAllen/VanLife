#### Summery of Van-Tastic App

This application uses MongoDB and Heroku to launch and maintain a VanLife experience for all Camper Van owners. This app is used to document ones personal experiences, travels, downfalls on the road, and much more. This will allow the users to look back on past experiences while traveling and reflect on each day spent on the road.

#### Unresolved Issues
Allowing the user to upload their own images.

Styling needs to be completed throughout the app.
